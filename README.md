# Pathtracer-rs

This is a work in progress path tracer written in pure rust, using `nalgebra` for mathematical operations, and `wgpu-rs` for frontend display.

This project heavily borrows from the book `Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation` by Matt Pharr et. al. which can be read online [here](http://www.pbr-book.org/).
